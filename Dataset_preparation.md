Positive Dataset
The positive dataset used in this tutorial comprises experimentally verified human-bacterial protein-protein interactions retrieved from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Centre (BV-BRC) database (https://www.bv-brc.org/). To access the data, navigate to the bacteria page (https://www.bv-brc.org/view/Bacteria/2), which lists 20 bacterial genera.

For this tutorial we selected a total of 4,459 interactions human-bacteria interactions from four genera, including 649 human-Bacillus, 62 human-Escherichia coli, 1,199 human-Francisella, and 2,549 human-Yersinia interactions. Other genera were excluded due to the absence or limited number of host-pathogen interactions data.

For each of the selected genera, repeat the following steps:

Click on the genus name to open its overview page.

Navigate to the Interactions tab.

Toggle the Filters display and apply the following filters:

Category: HPI (Host-Pathogen Interaction)

Evidence: Experimental

Genome Name B: Homo sapiens

Download the filtered interaction data as csv. This will serve as the HPI dataset.

Next, select the entire filtered interaction table and click on the FASTA icon to view FASTA protein. Download the resulting page as it contains the protein sequence (FASTA format) for all the interaction entries. This downloaded file will serve as your sequence dataset.
